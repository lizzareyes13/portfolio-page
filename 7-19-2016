what makes the functional style?

functions are first class citizens:
can be set as values to variables.

what characterizes the functional style?
purity.
loose coupling.
few (none, really) state changes.
higher reducibility - even "if" can be a function.

its pretty: Peano vs von neumann, haskell vs. java.



a self redefining incrementor:

}

	return function(b){

}



var maxtwo = curriedmax (8)(10) //
